          <p>
            This application aims to help engineering students in understanding analysis of frame structures by 
            providing sample problems and practice problems. In the sample problems, students can view the solutions 
            of the problems with explanation, specially on the construction of free body diagrams. The students 
            can then hone their skills in creating free body diagrams and formulating equilibrium equations through 
            the practice problems
